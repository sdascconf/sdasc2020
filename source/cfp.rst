Call for Papers
===============

The 2nd International Scalable Data Analytics in Scientific Computing (SDASC)
workshop invites submissions of original research. The event will be co-located
with the ISC High Performance 2021 conference. More details are available at:

https://sdascconf.github.io/

With the increasing importance of methods statistical inference and their
growing use at large cloud computing facilities, both scientific and HPC
communities are looking into new ways of applying this new computational
steering approach to their large scale simulations. The workshop will feature
efforts in automated data analysis at the convergence of computational science,
HPC, and large scale data analytics and/or inference. The focus will be on the
integration of the HPC techniques and statistical learning tasks into the
modern software stack of scalable computational science.

The half-day SDASC workshop will gather experts from the computational
science, HPC, and machine learning communities. The committee members
are recognized in their respective fields as experts of note and will
assure fulfilment of the goals of the workshop.

This workshop will complement the other events artificial intelligence, machine
learning, and data analytics taking place at ISC 2021.

------------------
Topics of Interest
------------------

A list of topics of interest for speakers and attendees include:

-  Scientific data set creation, labeling, ingest, curation, and analysis
   with statistical inference
-  Incorporating realtime and ad-hoc data analytics into applications
   and their deployment on supercomputing and large cluster platforms
-  Computational steering through machine learning models informed by domain
   science priors
-  Meta-data and data metrics collection and generation for large data
   collections and output data sets of computational simulations
-  Multi-precision inference methods and their use on modern hardware
   for simulation data
-  Novel use of discriminative and generative machine learning
   approaches for scientific data sets including adversarial and
   reinforcement learning
-  Modern HPC storage issues when dealing with integration of
   computational simulation outputs with data analytics software
-  Synchronous and asynchronous learning approaches at scale  for
   methods related to deep neural network training, stochastic gradient
   descent, loss-function engineering, Bayesian optimization, and others
-  Model derivation and training for scalable simulations and data sets
-  Hyperparameter search and optimization for large scale training and
   inference
-  Deployment of statistical models and their implementations such as
   TensorFlow, (Py)Torch, Caffe 1/2, Keras, MxNet combined with their
   integration with large scale simulations through containers
   (Kubernetes, Docker, Singularity, OpenShift), virtualizaiton,
   colocation, and other deployments
-  Pretrained models' creation, use, and scaling for scientific simulations

We also welcome cross-cutting submissions that span some of the topics
mentioned above.

---------------------
Submission guidelines
---------------------

The workshop will use single-blind peer review.  The submitted
manuscripts will be reviewed anonymously but the authors will be known
to the reviewers. Submissions will be scored on the following criteria:
originality, technical strength and correctness as well as significance,
quality of presentation, and relevance to the workshop topics.

With respect to originality: the submitted manuscripts should have _NOT_
appeared at another venue such as conference, workshop, symposium, or
published in a journal.  Also, the manuscript should _NOT_ be under
consideration for another venue or journal.

The accepted papers will be published in Springer proceedings (see
below for deadlines, dates, and format).

Manuscripts will be 12 pages maximum excluding the references (we
encourage authors to include relevant references).
Papers need to be formatted according to Springer's single column LNCS
style (see http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0
for LaTeX and Word templates).  Note: 12 pages LNCS is roughly
equivalent to 6 pages in double column IEEE format.

----------------------------
Additional Submission Format
----------------------------

We also intent to implement a unique format for submitting workshop
contributions: given the increasing relevance of sustainable software
development and open source community process, and acknowledging many
of the contributions in 2019 promoting software solutions, we will
allow for software submissions based on community-reviewed pull requests.
Specifically, authors can submit software contributions featuring detailed
software documentation, effectiveness and performance analysis by pointing
to a community-reviewed pull request in a versioning system. We will
complement the software review with a blind review assessing the
contribution's innovation level and community benefit, and decide on both,
scientific and software quality upon the acceptance of the contribution.
This workflow was recently proposed as a modern peer-reviewing concept for
computer-based research. Both, traditional contributions and software-based
contributions can be submitted to SDASC, and accepted contributions will be
presented at the half-day workshop and included in the post-conference
proceedings.

The submissions are handled by Easy Chair:
