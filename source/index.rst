With increasing importance of statistical inference methods and their use at
large cloud and warehouse-scale computing facilities, we will host the second
edition of the workshop called Scalable Data Analytics in Scientific Computing
(SDASC). It will feature automated data analysis efforts and the convergence of
computational science, HPC, and large-scale data analytics and/or inference.
The workshop will focus on integration of the HPC techniques, statistical
learning, and related data manipulation into modern computational software
stack.

This half-day workshop will gather experts from the computational science, HPC,
and machine learning. The committee members are recognized in their respective
fields as experts of note and will assure fulfilment of the goals of the
workshop outlined below.

This workshop will complement the other events artificial intelligence, machine
learning, and data analytics taking place at ISC 2021.

Finally, the workshop aims to establish a forum of discourse and exchange of
ideas about current practices for integration of HPC and data analytics. The
outcomes will include discussion about contemporary methods and implementation
techniques that unify modern statistical inference, latest software stacks for
machine learning deployed on supercomputing machines with hardware
accelerators.
